# FridayThe13Game

My first academic project written fully in procedural cpp. It is imitation of the "Friday the 13th Game" Reiner Knizia. 
In the base configuration 3 computers can play versus each other with different strategies. 
Implemented strategies are: to throw random cards, to throw minimal cards, to throw minimal cards but if you will lose you throw your most dangerous card. 
There are also results based on 3000+ games which strategy is the most effective.
